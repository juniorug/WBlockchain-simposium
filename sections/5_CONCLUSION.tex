\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}

Lately, Blockchain technology has been the subject of extensive research. Although some companies have launched pilot projects using blockchain technology https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e5e5dae5f434f0001ed5707to manage their supply chains, no detailed information on the technical implementation of such projects has been reported. Either way, the retail industry has the potential to use this technology to improve traceability.

Even if some properties of blockchain implementation may be useful for supply chain management, there are still few uses to support this claim. 

In this paper, we proposed a framework for new decentralized traceability systems based on blockchain technology. This system will deliver online information to all supply chain members on the safety status of goods, providing more secure, distributed, transparent, and collaborative approach to supply chain management. The framework can significantly improve development time of Supply Chain Management applications, and provide efficiency and transparency for product management on a supply chain.
